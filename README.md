Food safety is a big issue and needs to be addressed with the help of technology in order to curb the adverse effects both on human health as well as the environment.
According to the government policy the authority officials have to personally get to the place and perform the evaluation of the quality of the food article but with the help of this tool
the shoopkeepers will be able to track down their food article's expiry and act accordingly leading to reduction in the wastage of the article.
In this the tool the user is required to enter the category of the article and the date of purchase and the projected expiry date of the article will be displayed.
This tool can be used by the shopkeepers and the food safety officers.
Hope this tool proves to be helpful for all its users.
